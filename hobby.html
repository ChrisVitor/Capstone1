        I am always a music guy that since I was a child. Playing instruments is one of my strengths.
        This make me calm and relieve stress. I like old music from 70's to early 20's.

        I was a member of our school's badminton team. I wasn't able to achieve much with this side,  but I think a can play it decently.

        When I was still studying, I always want to solve problems. Math is always my favourite subject. It makes me feel satisfied or shall I say "evolved" like a Pokemon whenever they gain more experience and suddenly learn new skills.
